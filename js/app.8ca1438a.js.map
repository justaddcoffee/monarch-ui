In 2013, the program expanded to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN).\n      The UDN performs similar work, but now includes a number of clinical and research\n      sites across the United States.

For protection of participant privacy,\n      the case description does not include identifiable information.\n      Features of the participant’s medical condition are presented, along with genes of potential\n      interest. In addition, we provide similarity scores to diseases, other cases, and non-human models\n      based on phenotype profile comparisons computed by OwlSim.\n      If you are a researcher studying a listed gene or clinical feature, or if you have a\n      family member with a similar illness, please consider contacting the UDP.
